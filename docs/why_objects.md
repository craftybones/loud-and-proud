# Why Objects

Let us look at how the world exists without objects.

Neeraj and Pallabi are two people who are writing some code.
Neeraj wants to calculate the area of a square. So he writes this fancy function.

```javascript
var areaOfSquare=function(square) {
  return square.length * square.length;
};
```

You can see that his function expects an object that has the length property in it.
