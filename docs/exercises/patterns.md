#### Text based patterns

The aim of this exercise is to develop a library that can generate text based geometric patterns. There are several problems in this exercise. Do them one by one. As you attempt each, you might realise better ways of solving these.


**Filled Rectangle**

Generate a filled rectangle of MxN dimension. Additionally the user should be able to specify the character used to fill the rectangle.
<pre>
// 1 x 1, *
*

// 2 x 1, *
**

// 1 x 2, +
+
+

// 2 x 2, -
--
--

// 20 x 7, A
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
</pre>


**Hollow Rectangle**
Generate a hollow rectangle of MxN dimension. Additionally the user should be able to specify the character that outlines the rectangle.

<pre>
// 1 x 1, *
*

// 2 x 1, *
**

// 1 x 2, +
+
+

// 2 x 2, -
--

// 3 x 3, *

// 20 x 7, A
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
A                  A
A                  A
A                  A
A                  A
A                  A
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
</pre>
